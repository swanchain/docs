# Introduction to Swan Chain

SwanChain, initiated in 2021, is the first AI Super Chain dedicated to decentralized AI computing and development. Leveraging OP Super chain technology, Swan Chain integrates Web3 and AI by providing a comprehensive ecosystem that spans computing, storage, and AI applications. This includes specialized marketplaces for computing, storage, and AI agent applications, enabling seamless development, deployment, and scaling of AI models.

SwanChain harnesses underutilized computing power from a global network of community data centers, reducing costs by up to 70% and creating new opportunities to monetize idle resources. Its **AI Agent Market** and advanced toolsets, including inference and development tools, establish SwanChain as a premier AI cloud blockchain. By unifying decentralized infrastructure and AI innovation, SwanChain accelerates the adoption of AI, making development accessible, cost-efficient, and scalable. SwanChain’s mission is to redefine decentralized computing and drive innovation at the intersection of blockchain and artificial intelligence.

#### Core Objectives and Motivation

* **Decentralized AI Computing Market**: At the heart of Swan Chain's ambition is the creation of a marketplace that empowers AI developers with the necessary computational resources for training and deploying sophisticated AI models on AI platforms like [Lagrange](https://lagrange.computer/). This initiative is designed to fill the void between the high demand for premium computing in AI research and the resources available within the blockchain ecosystem.
* **Support for Web3 Projects**: Swan Chain acknowledges the transformative essence of Web3 technologies, aspiring to lay down a foundational infrastructure that underpins the deployment and functioning of decentralized applications (DApps). This includes a suite of decentralized storage solutions, computing power, and ancillary services, all aimed at propelling the decentralized web's expansion.
* **Innovative Ecosystem Products**: The ecosystem of Swan Chain is augmented with groundbreaking products like[ MultiChain.storage](https://www.multichain.storage) for decentralized data storage, the [Lagrange](https://lagrange.computer/) platform for decentralized computing, and a Decentralized Task Orchestrator, which collectively streamline the management and distribution of computing tasks across the network.
* **Universal Basic Income (UBI) Model**: A standout feature of Swan Chain is its commitment to fostering a fair and equitable ecosystem via the implementation of a UBI model for computing providers. This innovative approach guarantees compensation for participants' contributions, promoting inclusivity and sustainability within the network.

#### Enhanced Technologies and Infrastructure

Swan Chain incorporates state-of-the-art technologies to materialize its ambitious objectives:

* **Kubernetes and Blockchain Integration**: Utilizing Kubernetes for container orchestration alongside blockchain for securing transactions and automating processes, Swan Chain establishes a highly efficient, scalable, and secure infrastructure for decentralized computing.
* **Global Data Center Connectivity**: By orchestrating data centers globally, Swan Chain accesses an expansive pool of computational resources, ensuring utmost availability and redundancy for its services.
* **Zero-Knowledge (ZK) Proofs**: Emphasizing security and privacy, Swan Chain adopts ZK proofs for the benchmarking of computing providers and facilitating privacy-preserving transactions within its ecosystem.

#### Vision and Future Outlook

Swan Chain is steadfast in its mission to redefine the development, deployment, and scaling of AI and Web3 projects. By offering accessible, secure, and high-performance computing resources, coupled with innovative payment solutions and a ZK computing market, Swan Chain addresses the extant challenges faced by developers and businesses. The platform's dedication to a sustainable and equitable ecosystem, highlighted by its UBI model, paves the way for how decentralized networks can prioritize community welfare and participation.

## Protocol Stack

Cross Chain Computing Protocol

Swan Chain is designed as a full toolset AI Blockchain infrastructure, providing comprehensive solutions across storage, computing, bandwidth, and payments. The protocol stack is a multi-layered architecture that ensures efficient and secure operations within the Swan Chain ecosystem. Below is an overview of each layer in the protocol stack:

### Protocol Layers <a href="#protocol-layers" id="protocol-layers"></a>

1. [Consensus Layer](cross-chain-contracts.md)—responsible for smart contract execution and payment settlement.
2. [Peer-to-peer (P2P) Network](peer-to-peer-p2p-network.md)—defines how nodes locate and connect.
3. [Payment Channels ](payment-channels.md)—facilitates fast and low-cost payments in the system.
4. [Service Discovery](service-discovery.md) – Server nodes and reputation module for public service
5. [Market Provider](../bulders/market-provider/) - Entity that offers various computing and storage tasks to the network
6. [Storage Layer ](storage-layer.md)— data stored on public blockchains or content addressable networks.
7. [Computing Layer ](computing-layer/)— how a query is routed to a specific node for computing.
8. [CDN Layer](cdn-layer.md) – how data is distributed and hosted on the global network
9. [Governance](token/governance/) —manages schemas, treasure, and disputes.
