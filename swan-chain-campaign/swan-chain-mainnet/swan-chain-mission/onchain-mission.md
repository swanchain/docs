# Onchain Mission

Welcome to the new phase of the Swan Chain Mission, where we shift from a focus on Social Missions to Onchain Missions. In this phase, participants will have the opportunity to earn Onchain XP, which will directly determine their allocation of $SWAN tokens. This phase will reward participants for their active onchain contributions to the Swan Chain ecosystem.

### Onchain XP

Onchain XP is the new key metric for earning $SWAN tokens. Unlike the previous Social Mission, which was based on Social Points, this phase prioritizes onchain actions and contributions. Participants can earn Onchain XP in a variety of ways, including:

#### 1. Wallet Balance

Participants will earn Onchain XP simply by holding funds on Swan Chain. The more ETH you hold, the more XP you accumulate, rewarding your ongoing commitment to the Swan Chain ecosystem.

* XP earning rate: 50 XPs/day per ETH holding
* XP will be counted and updated every 5 minutes

**Important note:**

* For users that haven’t had ETH on Swan Chain, you will need to **use the suggested bridges listed on** [**mission.swanchain.io**](https://mission.swanchain.io/) **to start earning XP**.
* For users that already have ETH on Swan Chain, you will need to **make a** **transfer with any amount of ETH to any address on Swan Chain** to let the system recognize your existing fund.

#### 2. Computing Provider (CP) Tasks

Involvement in Computing Provider (CP) tasks within the Swan Chain network will also earn participants Onchain XP. Completing CP tasks is an excellent way to contribute to the network's functionality while earning additional rewards.

#### 3. Other Tasks

There will be additional opportunities to earn Onchain XP through a range of other tasks and activities. These will be announced throughout the mission, ensuring there are numerous ways to get involved and maximize your XP earnings.

### Referral Program

In this phase, you can also earn a 10% bonus based on the earnings of those you refer to the Swan Chain Mission. For every person who joins through your referral link and earns XP, you will receive a 10% bonus of their earnings. This is a great way to amplify your rewards by growing the Swan Chain community.

Note: Successful referrals from Social Mission will remain valid for Onchain Mission.

### Airdrop Bonus

The airdrop allocation in this phase is determined by a combination of your Social Points and your Onchain XP. Here's how it works:

* **Social Points:** These will determine your airdrop bonus percentage, which can range from 0% to 100%, depending on your ranking.
* **Onchain XP:** This will directly determine your base $SWAN token allocation.

#### Example

If you achieved a high rank in the Social Mission and earned a 90% airdrop bonus, and your Onchain XP qualifies you for a base token allocation of 1000 $SWAN, your final airdrop allocation would be calculated as follows:

Final Airdrop Allocation = 1000 \* (1 + 90%) = 1900 $SWAN
