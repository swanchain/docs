# ZK-UBI Pool

Swan’s ZK-UBI mechanism integrates various zk proof computations over time, such as Filecoin commit2, Aleo, StarkNet, Scroll, etc.

The ZK-UBI Task Pool serves as a centralized hub for various zk workloads for CPs:

* Storage Providers can contribute their ZK-proof work to enrich the pool of tasks
* Computing Providers can receive tasks from ZK-UBI task pool
* CPs generate proofs recorded on Swan Chain, allowing Storage providers to directly access the proofs they need.

By deeply integrating Filecoin’s intensive workloads and establishing an open task pool, Swan’s zk-UBI brings about mutually reinforcing network collaborations.
