## What You Need

**Gas Fees:**

* Gas fees are transaction fees required to execute a transaction. These vary by blockchain. For Swan Chain transactions, ETH is required.

**Payment to Computing Providers:**

* In addition to gas fees, you must pay Computing Providers in SWAN to utilize their computing resources to power your Space (Application).

**Collateral :**

* Computing Providers (including FCPs and ECPs) must deposit a certain amount of SWAN as collateral. Ensure you meet this requirement to receive task assignments.&#x20;

## Fund Your Wallet

**Step 1: Purchasing ETH**

Fund your wallet with ETH from any Decentralized Exchange (DEX) or Centralized Exchange (CEX).

Funding your network account is required to use the network. All transactions, including claiming Swan Credit tokens and deploying Spaces, charge a transaction fee. Ensure you have sufficient ETH to cover these costs.

**Step 2: Bridge ETH from Ethereum to Swan Chain**

Go to[ Bridge](https://bridge.swanchain.io/), enter the amount of ETH you wish to bridge, and click on the "Deposit" button.
