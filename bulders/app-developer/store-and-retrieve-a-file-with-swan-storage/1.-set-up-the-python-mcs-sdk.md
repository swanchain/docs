### 1.4 Initialize the SDK

To use python-MCS-SDK, you must first import it and state your identity.

```python
from swan_mcs import APIClient
import logging
# Set logging level to be sure that you can see the info level message
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)
# Let's initialize the Python-MCS-SDK
mcs_api = APIClient("<API_KEY>")
```

If you see "Login Successful" in the console, you have logged in successfully.  The following code will take you through the initialization of services.

```python
from swan_mcs import BucketAPI
# Init bucket client
bucket_client = BucketAPI(mcs_api)
```
