# ZK Task

The ZK (Zero-Knowledge) Task on Swan Chain is an innovative implementation that blends a Universal Basic Income model with the privacy and efficiency of zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs), underpinned by an embedded ZK market. This integration creates a self-sustaining and privacy-preserving ecosystem for participants who contribute computing resources.

#### Concept and Functionality

**ZK Model**: The ZK model within Swan Chain is a groundbreaking economic system designed to provide a guaranteed basic income to network participants. It leverages zero-knowledge proofs to validate the contributions of computing providers without revealing sensitive data.

**Zero-Knowledge Proofs**: ZKPs are a form of cryptographic protocol that allow one party (the prover) to prove to another party (the verifier) that a statement is true, without revealing any information beyond the validity of the statement itself.

[**Embedded ZK Market**](./): Swan Chain integrates a specialized ZK market that serves as a platform for various blockchain protocols in need of ZK computation, such as Aleo, Filecoin, and StarkNet. This market is where tasks requiring ZK proofs are listed and sourced.

#### Workflow

1. **Task Generation**: Blockchain protocols that require ZK computations generate tasks. These could include private transaction verification for Aleo, proof-of-replication for Filecoin, or scalability solutions for StarkNet.
2. **ZK Task Pool**: The generated tasks are pooled into a ZK Task Pool, where they are made available to computing providers on the Swan Network.
3. **Task Completion for Income**: Computing providers on Swan Chain select tasks from the pool, complete the computations, and generate ZK proofs. By completing these tasks, they earn $SWAN, the native cryptocurrency of Swan Chain, as part of their UBI.
4. **Proof Submission and Verification**: Upon completion, providers submit their ZK proofs back to the Swan Chain for verification. This ensures the integrity and validity of the computations performed.
5. **UBI Distribution**: Once verified, the ZK proofs trigger the smart contract-based UBI system to distribute $SWAN to the computing providers, ensuring a steady income stream and incentivizing continuous participation in the network.
