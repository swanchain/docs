An AI computing and storage bid market is a decentralized platform where users can post requests for computing power and storage space and hire other users to provide these services. These platforms are built on blockchain technology and use smart contracts to create a transparent and secure marketplace where users can buy and sell computing and storage resources.

In a Web3 computing and storage bid market, users can post requests for computing power or storage space and specify the requirements, budget, and deadline. Other users can then bid on the request, offering their computing or storage resources and proposing a price for providing these services. The user who posted the request can then review the bids and select the one that best meets their needs.

The use of blockchain technology in a Web3 computing and storage bid market provides several benefits, such as:

1. Decentralization: The platform is decentralized, meaning that there is no central authority or intermediary controlling the transactions. This eliminates the need for intermediaries and reduces the risk of fraud.
2. Transparency: Transactions on the platform are transparent and recorded on a distributed ledger, making it difficult to tamper with or manipulate the data.
3. Security: Smart contracts are used to automate the bidding and payment process, ensuring that both parties are protected from fraud or default.
4. Lower transaction fees: Since there are no intermediaries involved, the transaction fees on a Web3 computing and storage bid market are typically lower than those of traditional marketplaces.

Swan bidding market is built on the Filecoin blockchain. Swan provides a platform where users can rent computing power to complete tasks, such as rendering 3D graphics or machine learning algorithms. Users can also rent storage space to store their data. Swan uses a decentralized network of nodes to provide these services, and users can earn cryptocurrency by renting out their computing or storage resources. Swan also provides a matchmaking system that connects users with the computing and storage resources they need.
