## Overview

Mission 3.0 is a next-generation engagement platform designed to empower both users and projects (Space Holders) in the Web3 ecosystem. Whether you’re an individual looking to participate in Quests and earn rewards, or a project aiming to grow and engage your community, Mission 3.0 provides the tools to make it happen.

#### Two Key Roles in Mission 3.0

* **Users (Quest Participants):** Explore Spaces, complete Quests, earn rewards, and build your on-chain identity. Check out tutorial [here](for-users.md).
* **Project Owner (Space Holder)**: Create Spaces, launch Quests, track engagement, and manage your Web3 community. Check out tutorial [here](for-space-holders.md).

This guide will walk you through how to get started with Mission 3.0, tailored to your role. Whether you're here to discover and complete Quests or launch and manage your own Space, we’ve got you covered!&#x20;
