# 1. Set up the python-MCS-SDK

To begin using Swan Storage, you need to install and configure the python-MCS-SDK.

### 1.1 Install Python

Ensure you have Python 3.7 or later installed on your system.

For information about how to get the latest version of Python, see the official [Python documentation](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### 1.2 Install python-MCS-SDK

Install the latest python-MCS-SDK release via **pip:**

`pip install python-MCS-SDK`

{% hint style="info" %}
The latest development version of python-MCS-SDK is on [GitHub](https://github.com/filswan/python-mcs-sdk)
{% endhint %}

### 1.3 Configure the SDK

Before using the SDK, you need to generate an API key from the MCS website.

1. Visit [https://www.multichain.storage/#/my\_account](https://www.multichain.storage/#/my\_account)
2. Generate an API key and Access Token
3. Save your API key and Access Token securely

### 1.4 Initialize the SDK

To use python-MCS-SDK, you must first import it and state your identity.

```python
from swan_mcs import APIClient
# Let's initialize the Python-MCS-SDK
mcs_api = APIClient("<API_KEY>", "<ACCESS_TOKEN>", "<CHAIN_NAME>")
# polygon.mainnet for mainnet, polygon.mumbai for testnet
```

If you see "Login Successful" in the console, you have logged in successfully. Now you can choose which service you want to initialize: Onchain or Buckets. The following code will take you through the initialization of both services.

```python
from swan_mcs import BucketAPI, OnchainAPI
# Init bucket client
bucket_client = BucketAPI(mcs_api)
# Init onchain client
onchain_client = OnchainAPI(mcs_api)
```

You can also use the storage resource from the python-swan-sdk

```python
import swan
# init bucket client
bucket_client = swan.resource(api_key="<YOUR_MCS_API_KEY>",service_name='storage')
```

This will also show "Login Successful" in the console if you have logged in successfully.
