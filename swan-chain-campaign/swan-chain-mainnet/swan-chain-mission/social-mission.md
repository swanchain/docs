# Social Mission

## What is Swan Mission Point?

Earn Mission Point by participating in tasks within the Swan Chain Mission through simple social activities. You can also earn points by inviting friends and playing the Daily Combo game.

You can earn points in three ways:

1. **Complete Tasks:** Earn points for each task you complete. New tasks are released daily, so be sure to check back regularly.
2. **Play Daily Combo:** The “Daily Combo” section offers a special task that can earn you significant points. Participating in this minigame will help you maximize your rewards.
3. **Invite Friends:** Earn points every time someone you invite signs up and completes social media tasks. You’ll receive 10% of the total points they earn. There’s no limit to how many friends you can refer, so the more friends you invite, the more points you can accumulate!

1. **Connect Wallet & Social Account:** Follow the event instructions to connect your wallet and social account. This will allow you to track your progress and receive rewards.
2. **Complete Tasks:** Navigate to the “Available Tasks” section to find tasks you can complete to earn points. Read the instructions for each task carefully and complete them accordingly. Once finished, the task will move to the “Task Pending Verification” section.
3. **Task Verification:** The system will verify your completed tasks within 24–48 hours. After verification, your tasks will appear in the “Completed Tasks” section.
4. **Daily Combo:** The Daily Combo includes a set of 12 data blocks with a secret combination that changes daily. You need to place the correct 3 data blocks together. Points are awarded as follows:

* 3 correct blocks = 100% reward
* 2 correct blocks = 50% reward
* 1 correct block = 25% reward
* 0 correct blocks = 0 points.

Daily points will be reset every 24 hours at 23:59 EST.

## Referral

The Swan Chain Mission also includes a referral task. By inviting friends to join Swan’s journey, you earn points each time they complete social media tasks. You receive 10% of the total points they earn from social tasks, and your friends also get a 20% point boost. There’s no limit to how many people you can refer.
