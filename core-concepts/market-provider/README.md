# Market Provider

#### Market Provider

A Market Provider (MP) in the Swan network is a crucial entity that offers various computing and storage tasks to the network. These tasks can range from storage tasks like dataset management, network tasks like CDN, to GPU tasks such as zk proofs or AI computations. MPs utilize the vast computing resources of Swan's decentralized community and, in return, can earn revenue through commissions or by issuing their own tokens based on the Swan network.

**Key Features of Market Providers:**

1. **Diverse Task Offerings**:
   * **Storage Tasks**: Handling datasets and ensuring efficient, secure storage solutions.
   * **Network Tasks**: Providing content delivery network (CDN) services to enhance data distribution.
   * **GPU Tasks**: Managing complex computations like zk proofs and AI model training.
2. **Utilizing Decentralized Resources**:
   * MPs leverage the distributed computing power of the Swan community, optimizing resource usage and ensuring high performance.
