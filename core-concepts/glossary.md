# Glossary

* **Swan Chain:** A Layer 2 blockchain network that enhances the capabilities of an underlying blockchain (like Ethereum) for decentralized computing and storage, offering scalability and efficiency.
* **UBI (Universal Basic Income):** A feature within Swan Chain that ensures providers receive a minimum payment, encouraging consistent availability of decentralized services.
* **MP (Market Provider):** A platform that facilitates the allocation of computing jobs to providers, utilizing an auction engine for job distribution and a payment engine for financial transactions. It connects job requesters with providers, ensuring efficiency and transparency in job assignments and compensations.
* **FCP (Fog Computing Provider):** Offers a layered network that extends cloud capabilities to the edge of the network, providing services such as AI model training and deployment. This provider utilizes infrastructure like Kubernetes (K8S) to support scalable, distributed computing tasks.
* **ECP (Edge Computing Provider):** Specializes in processing data at the source of data generation, using minimal latency setups ideal for real-time applications. This provider handles specific, localized tasks directly on devices at the networkâ€™s edge, such as IoT devices.
* **Public Service Jobs:** Tasks generated by Swan Chain to maintain provider engagement and system stability, especially when the UBI distribution is higher than a set target.
* **Creator Grants:** Rewards issued by Swan Chain for contributing new tasks or services, promoting innovation and expansion within the network.
* **Reputation Score:** A metric used within Swan Chain to assess the performance and reliability of providers, potentially influencing their eligibility for UBI and tasks.
* **Block Time:** The time interval Swan Chain takes to finalize and add a new set of transactions to the blockchain.
* **Blacklist:** A registry on Swan Chain of providers who have been deemed unreliable or who have failed to secure jobs within a specific timeframe, affecting their network privileges.
* **zk-proof (Zero-Knowledge Proof):** A cryptographic technique used on Swan Chain that allows a party to prove possession of certain information without revealing the information itself, enhancing privacy and security.
* **Treasure DAO:** The decentralized autonomous organization on Swan Chain tasked with managing funds and allocations for UBI, network tasks, and creative incentives.
* **Committee:** A group within Swan Chain, likely comprising stakeholders like token holders and developers, responsible for decision-making regarding fund management and network governance.
* **Staking Reward:** Incentives provided to participants who lock their tokens as a form of security or investment in Swan Chain, supporting its operations.
* **Target UBI Rate:** The desired proportion of providers receiving UBI within Swan Chain. If exceeded, additional network tasks may be generated to balance the system.
* **Average Job Duration:** The typical length of time a task or job takes to be completed by a provider on Swan Chain.
* **Job Price:** The amount of compensation set for the completion of a specific task within Swan Chain.
* **Swan AP (Accounts Payable) and Swan AR (Accounts Receivable):** Financial terms adapted for Swan Chain, indicating modules that manage outgoing and incoming transactions, respectively.
* **Swan Hub:** A central node or sector within Swan Chain that facilitates interactions and transactions between users and providers, possibly through regional hubs.
