# Developer Tools

Welcome to the Swan developer tools! If you're already familiar with building on Swan Mainnet and need the tools to get started, you're in the right place. Below, you'll find an overview of the key components in the Swan ecosystem.

### Lagrange: Decentralized NLP Platform

Lagrange(lagrange.computer) is a cutting-edge Web3 platform for natural language processing (NLP) development and deployment. Built on the Swan Chain computing network, it offers:

* Cost-effective alternative to centralized cloud services
* Enhanced security and interoperability
* Decentralized infrastructure for NLP tasks

Learn more about Lagrange in its [documentation](https://docs.lagrangedao.org/).

### Multi-Chain Storage (MCS)

Developed by the Swan Network, Multi-Chain Storage (MCS) is a revolutionary storage service compatible with various blockchain networks. Key features include:

* Smart contract integration for improved security
* Decentralized architecture
* Cross-chain compatibility

Explore MCS capabilities in its [documentation](https://docs.filswan.com/multichain.storage/overview).

### Swan SDK

The Swan SDK is your go-to toolkit for interacting with the Swan Chain Network Resource. It simplifies:

* Creating and managing computational tasks
* Retrieving hardware information
* Processing payments
* Monitoring task statuses

Dive into the Swan SDK [here](swan-sdk/).

### Nebula Block Cloud

Nebula Block is a forward-thinking Montreal-based startup, specializing in advanced cloud computing and blockchain infrastructure solutions. Nebula Block offers:

* Secure and scalable computing environments
* Cost-effective solutions for academic and commercial institutions
* Advanced blockchain integration
