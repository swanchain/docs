## A Next Chapter! <a href="#e44e" id="e44e"></a>

We’re incredibly excited to introduce **Celestial Bloom**, a unique event designed as a direct continuation of our journey together following Season 1. As Swan Chain continues to expand and mature, we’re eager to offer new ways for our amazing community to grow with us. **Celestial Bloom** not only celebrates our ongoing progress but also plays an essential role in helping Swan Chain reach key growth targets that will fuel our future development.

This campaign brings meaningful new opportunities for members to engage and be rewarded, with both **$SWAN** and **$OP tokens**, supported by the Optimism grant. Your participation strengthens the Swan Chain network, helping us showcase the vibrant and thriving community behind our project.

## Start Date & Mission Link <a href="#id-4853" id="id-4853"></a>

* **Launch Date:** Nov 26, 2024, 5:00 PM UTC
* **Mission Access**:[ mission.swanchain.io](https://mission.swanchain.io/)

## Contribution Rewards <a href="#id-7346" id="id-7346"></a>

**Celestial Bloom’s rewards** are thoughtfully designed to encourage active participation, making every engagement both rewarding and impactful.

Support Swan Chain’s growth and activity while providing you with a meaningful role in building and strengthening our network. At the end of the campaign, **eligible participants** will receive the following rewards:

* **1M SWAN tokens**
* **150K OP tokens**

## Threshold Requirement: <a href="#fe24" id="fe24"></a>

To unlock **OP rewards**, certain milestones must be met. While there are multiple requirements, we only display the TVL (Total Value Locked) thresholds for simplicity.

* Reaching **$1.5M TVL** within **2 months** → **45K OP unlocked**
* Reaching **$2.5M TVL** within **4 months** → **45K OP unlocked**
* Reaching **$3M TVL** within **6 months** → **60K OP unlocked**

The milestone is only valid if the **TVL** maintains the required level on the **due date**.

**Example:**

* If TVL hits **$1.5M** on **January 13**, but drops to **$1.4M** by the due date (**January 15**) → **OP rewards are not unlocked**
* If TVL reaches or exceeds **$1.5M** on **January 15**, even if it drops later → **OP rewards are unlocked**

## Key Celestial Bloom Updates: <a href="#id-6403" id="id-6403"></a>

### Mechanics: <a href="#id-7bf7" id="id-7bf7"></a>

As with **Season 1**, rewards are based on **Social Points** and **On-chain XP**, now enhanced to more accurately recognize and reward your contributions.

* **Social Points:** Determine your airdrop bonus percentage, ranging from **0% to 50%**, based on your community engagement.
* **On-chain XP:** Directly affects your base allocation of **$SWAN** and possibly **$OP** tokens, rewarding active participation in on-chain activities.

**1. Refined Daily Combo:**

Adapted from **Season 1**, this feature has been improved to drive more engagement in Celestial Bloom.

  &#xNAN;**—** 0 correct answers = **0 points**

**2. Community Boost:**

The Community Boost section is removed from the Mission page.

**3. Enhanced Login Security:**
