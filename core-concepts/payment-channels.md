# Payment Channels

Payment channels can also be used in multi-chain solutions, which aim to enable interoperability between different blockchain networks. In a multi-chain solution, payment channels can be used to enable fast and efficient cross-chain transactions between two parties, without the need for a traditional on-chain transaction on each blockchain.

In this context, payment channels can be seen as a way to bridge the gap between different blockchain networks, enabling users to transact with each other across different chains, without the need for intermediaries or centralized exchanges.

One example of a multi-chain solution that uses payment channels is the Raiden Network, which is built on top of the Ethereum blockchain. The Raiden Network enables users to open payment channels with each other, which can be used to transact off-chain with any other user on the network. The Raiden Network also supports cross-chain payments, allowing users to transfer tokens between different blockchains using payment channels.

Another example of a multi-chain solution that uses payment channels is the Cosmos Network, which is a decentralized network of independent blockchains that can communicate with each other using payment channels. The Cosmos Network uses a protocol called Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) to enable communication and transactions between different blockchains, and payment channels can be used to facilitate fast and efficient transactions between two parties on different chains.

Overall, payment channels play an important role in enabling fast and efficient cross-chain transactions in multi-chain solutions, helping to overcome the challenges of interoperability between different blockchain networks.
