# App Developer

Welcome, Web2 developers! This guide will walk you through the process of building applications on [Swan Chain Mainnet](../../swan-chain-campaign/swan-chain-mainnet/network-information.md). If you're new to the web3 world, don't worry - we'll start with the basics and gradually move to more advanced topics.

### Getting Started

Before diving into development, make sure you:

* [Set up your wallet](https://docs.swanchain.io/network-reference/readme/set-up-your-wallet)
* [Bridge tokens from Ethereum to Swan Mainnet](https://docs.swanchain.io/network-reference/readme/bridge-token)

### What You Can Do with Swan Chain

#### **Deploying with Swan SDK**

* The Swan SDK simplifies interactions with the Swan Chain Network Resource.
* Learn to create and manage computational tasks, retrieve hardware information, process payments, and monitor task statuses.

Explore Swan SDK deployment [here](deploying-with-swan-sdk.md).

#### **Store and Retrieve Files with Swan Storage**

* Utilize Multi-Chain Storage (MCS), Swan Chain's decentralized storage solution.
* Learn to install and configure the MCS SDK, manage storage buckets, and handle file operations.

Discover Swan Storage capabilities [here](store-and-retrieve-a-file-with-swan-storage/).

**Building and Pushing Docker Images**

* Learn how to create Docker images for your applications.
* Explore the process of pushing your Docker images to repositories.&#x20;

Get started with Docker [here](building-and-pushing-docker-images.md).

#### Creating Deployment Files with LDL

* The basics of LDL and its relationship to YAML
* How to create `deploy.yaml` files for your Swan Chain projects
* Key components of an LDL file: version, services, profiles, and deployment

Dive into LDL and deployment files [here](creating-deployment-files-with-ldl.md).
